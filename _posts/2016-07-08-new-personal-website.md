title: New personal website as a blog.

My previous website was hosted at my home geographically located in Hong Kong. However, due to the unreliable network without a static IP, the site always goes offline. So I have given up hosting the physical server myself and decided to switch to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). 

It looks like that [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a very common framework(?) that could be hosted with github page. Surprisingly, the setup is really simple as it advertises. So here it is, the new website.
