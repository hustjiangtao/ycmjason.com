# Here is a little script to grab a list of all font names on Google Fonts.

## Background
So if you have already read my previous post about [faviator](https://github.com/faviator/faviator), you might have visited the [faviator playground](https://www.faviator.xyz/playground).

I am very grateful to have received 19 stars (including my own star) on [GitHub](https://github.com/faviator/faviator) last week. My first goal for this project is to collect 100 stars, so please be generous.

This week has been very exciting, I have got a few [issues](https://github.com/faviator/faviator/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) raised on github which implies that somebody is actually using faviator! Yay!

I heard some feedback regarding the faviator playground. One of which suggests to provide a dropdown to make font style selecting easier.

So I decided to work on this one first.

## Exploring Google Font API
The [Google Font API](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/developer_api) is a very simple API. The API has only one endpoint which returns all font information given your API key.

```
https://www.googleapis.com/webfonts/v1/webfonts?key=YOUR-API-KEY
```

You can generate your own API key [here](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/developer_api). The endpoint above return something like the following.

```
{
  "kind": "webfonts#webfontList",
  "items": [
    {
      "kind": "webfonts#webfont",
      "family": "ABeeZee",
      "category": "sans-serif",
      "variants": [
        "regular",
        "italic"
      ],
      "subsets": [
        "latin"
      ],
      "version": "v11",
      "lastModified": "2017-10-10",
      "files": {
        "regular": "http://fonts.gstatic.com/s/abeezee/v11/mE5BOuZKGln_Ex0uYKpIaw.ttf",
        "italic": "http://fonts.gstatic.com/s/abeezee/v11/kpplLynmYgP0YtlJA3atRw.ttf"
      }
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

Nice! So we somewhat have all the family names, but I don't want to serve such a large file to my frontend just for the names. So I started writing a script to grab all the font names.

## The bash script

[`grepFonts.bash`](https://github.com/faviator/faviator.xyz/blob/dev/scripts/grepFonts.bash)
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
KEY=$1

echo '['

curl -s "https://www.googleapis.com/webfonts/v1/webfonts?key=$KEY&sort=alpha" | \
  sed -n 's/ *"family": "\(.*\)",/  "\1",/p' | \
  sed '$s/\(.*\),/\1/'

echo ']'
```

Usage:

```
> bash grepFonts.bash YOUR-API-KEY
[
  "ABeeZee",
  "Abel",
  "Abhaya Libre",
  "Abril Fatface",
  "Aclonica",
  "Acme",
  ...
  "Zeyada",
  "Zilla Slab",
  "Zilla Slab Highlight"
]
```

And here we go, no more frustration when selecting text on [faviator playground](https://www.faviator.xyz/playground)!
