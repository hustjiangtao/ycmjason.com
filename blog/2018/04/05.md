# 05 April 2018 - Javascript fetch, retry upon failure.

> This post is republished since the previous one was not showing up on my profile for some reason.

So recently, I bumped into a situation where the network works/fails randomly. As it affects the consistency of my test results, I decided to implement a `fetch_retry` function which retries `fetch` upon failure up to `n` times.

# Introduction

[Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) in Javascript is great. I hope you will agree that it provides a simple yet robust enough interface to do our AJAX requests.

However, network doesn't always work like we want it to, and it might fail randomly. To catch this issue, let's implement a function `fetch_retry(url, options, n)` which does `fetch(url, options)` but retries up to `n` times upon failure. And hence increasing the chance of success.

# Let's think
Retrying things sounds like a loop. Why don't we write a for/while loop to do that? Something like the following, perhaps?
```javascript
function fetch_retry(url, options, n) {
    for(let i = 0; i < n; i++){
        fetch(url, options);
        if(succeed) return result;
    }
}
```

**NO!** Fetch is an asynchronous function, meaning that the program would not wait for result before continuing! `n` fetches will be called at the same time (kind of), regardless of whether the previous calls succeed! 

This is not what we want. This is not retry upon failure, this is fetching `n` times simultaneously! (That being said, if written correctly, it could also increase the chance of success. Perhaps with something like [`Promsie.any`](http://bluebirdjs.com/docs/api/promise.any.html)? Although I am not a big fan of bluebird. I think native Promise is good enough.)

If you don't know about asynchronous functions and `Promise` in Javascript, watch this amazing video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2CsiEum0CU), made by [Jessica Kerr](https://dev.to/jessitron), before reading on! 

# Briefly about fetch
So `fetch` returns a `Promise`. We usually call it like this.
```javascript
fetch(url, { method: 'GET' }).then(res => console.log('done'));
console.log('fetching...');
```
If you understand `Promise` correctly, you should expect the result to be:
```
fetching...
done
```

And if the network fails for some reason, the `Promise` rejects and we could catch the error as follows:

```javascript
fetch(url, { method: 'GET' }).catch(err => /* ... */);
```

# So how to implement?

## What does `fetch_retry` do?
We start off with thinking what do we want the function `fetch_retry` do.  We know it has to call fetch somehow, so let's write that down.
```javascript
function fetch_retry(url, options, n) {
	fetch(url, options)
		.then(function(result) {
			/* on success */
		}).catch(function(error) {
			/* on failure */
		})
}
```

Now obviously `fetch_retry` has to be an asynchronous function, since we can't really define a synchronous function out of an asynchronous one. (or could we? Enlighten me.)

Definition: *So this means `fetch_retry` should return a `Promise` that resolves if any attempt out of `n` attempts succeed, and rejects if all `n` attempts failed.*

So let's return a `Promise` now.
```javascript
function fetch_retry(url, options, n) {
	return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) { // <--- we know it is asynchronous, so just return a promise first!
		fetch(url, options)
			.then(function(result) {
				/* on success */
			}).catch(function(error) {
				/* on failure */
			})
	});
}
```

## What if `fetch` succeeds?
So if the fetch succeed, we obviously can just resolve the promise we are returning, by calling the `resolve` function. So the code become:
```javascript
function fetch_retry(url, options, n) {
	return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
		fetch(url, options)
			.then(function(result) {
				/* on success */
				resolve(result); // <--- yeah! we are done!
			}).catch(function(error) {
				/* on failure */
			})
	});
}
```
## What if `fetch` fails?
What should we do on failure? Doing for/while loop here wouldn't really help, due to the asynchronous property we discussed previously. But there is one thing that we could do what for/while loop does. Does it ring a bell? Yes! **Recursion!**

My two rules of thumb when doing recursion: 
1. Do not think recursively. Don't try to follow your code recursively.
2. Leap of faith, assume the recursive function you are defining works.

These two points are fundamentally the same! If you have the **leap of faith**, you wouldn't be thinking recursively into the code.

Ok, so let's try to take the **leap of faith** and assume `fetch_retry` will just work, magically.

If it works, then in `on failure`, what will happen if we call `fetch_retry(url, options, n - 1)`?
```javascript
function fetch_retry(url, options, n) {
	return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
		fetch(url, options)
			.then(function(result) {
				/* on success */
				resolve(result);
			})
			.catch(function(error) {
				/* on failure */
				fetch_retry(url, options, n - 1) // <--- leap of faith, this will just work magically! Don't worry!
					.then(/* one of the remaining (n - 1) fetch succeed */)
					.catch(/* remaining (n - 1) fetch failed */);
			})
	});
}
```

`fetch_retry(url, options, n - 1)` will just work magically by the **leap of faith** and would return a `Promise` which, by the definition we discussed previously, resolves if any attempt (out of `n - 1` attempts) succeed, and rejects if all `n - 1` attempts failed. 

So now, what do we do after the recursive call? Notice that since `fetch_retry(url, options, n - 1)` would work magically, this means we have done all `n` fetching at this point. In the `on failure` case, simply resolves if `fetch_retry(url, options, n - 1)` resolves, and rejects if it rejects.

```javascript
function fetch_retry(url, options, n) {
	return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
		fetch(url, options)
			.then(function(result) {
				/* on success */
				resolve(result);
			})
			.catch(function(error) {
				fetch_retry(url, options, n - 1)
					.then(resolve)  // <--- simply resolve
					.catch(reject); // <--- simply reject
			})
	});
}
```

Great! We are almost there! We know we need a base case for this recursive call. When thinking about base case, we look at the function arguments, and decide at what situation we could tell the result immediately. 

The answer is when `n === 1` and the `fetch` fails. In this case, we could simply reject with the error from `fetch`, without calling `fetch_retry` recursively.

```javascript
function fetch_retry(url, options, n) {
	return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
		fetch(url, options)
			.then(function(result) {
				/* on success */
				resolve(result);
			})
			.catch(function(error) {
				if (n === 1) return reject(error); // <--- base case!
				fetch_retry(url, options, n - 1)
					.then(resolve)
					.catch(reject);
			})
	});
}
```

## Clean things up
### Redundant function
In our "on success" function, we are simply calling `resolve(result)`. So this function instance is redundant, we could simply use `resolve` as the "on success" function. So the code would become:

```javascript
function fetch_retry(url, options, n) {
	return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
		fetch(url, options).then(resolve) // <--- Much cleaner!
			.catch(function(error) {
				if (n === 1) return reject(error);
				fetch_retry(url, options, n - 1)
					.then(resolve)
					.catch(reject);
			})
	});
}
```

### Redundant promise
Now another stupid thing we are doing here is this line:
```javascript
fetch_retry(url, options, n - 1).then(resolve).catch(reject)
```
Do you see what is the problem?

Let me put this in context, we are essentially doing this:
```javascript
new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
	fetch_retry(url, options, n - 1).then(resolve).catch(reject)
});
```

So this new promise is redundant in this case, because it is resolving if `fetch_retry` resolves, and rejecting if `fetch_retry` rejects. So basically it behaves exactly the same as how `fetch_retry` behaves!

So the above code is basically semantically the same as just `fetch_retry` by itself.

```javascript
fetch_retry(url, options, n - 1)
// sementically the same thing as the following
new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
	fetch_retry(url, options, n - 1).then(resolve).catch(reject)
});
```

It require one more knowledge in order to clean up the code. We could chain `promise.then`s in the following way. Because `promise.then` returns a promise as well!
```javascript
Promise.resolve(3).then(function(i) {
	return i * 2;
}).then(function(i) {
	return i === 6; // this will be true
});
```

As you can see, we could pass the processed value onward to the next `then` and so on. If the value is a `Promise`, then the next `then` would receive whatever the returned `Promise` resolves. See below:

```javascript
Promise.resolve(3).then(function(i) {
	return i * 2;
}).then(function(i) {
	return Promise.resolve(i * 2); // also work!
}).then(function(i) {
	return i === 12; // this is true! i is not a Promise!
};
```

The same idea could be applied to `catch` as well! Thanks to [Corentin](https://dev.to/viki53) for the shout out! So this means that we could even resolve a promise when it rejects. Here is an example:

```javascript
Promise.resolve(3).then(function(i) {
	throw "something's not right";
}).catch(function(i) {
	return i
}).then(function(i) {
	return i === "something's not right";
};
```

So how could we clean up with these knowledge? The code we have seem to be more complicated. 
```javascript
function fetch_retry(url, options, n) {
	return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
		fetch(url, options).then(resolve)
			.catch(function(error) {
				if (n === 1) return reject(error);
				fetch_retry(url, options, n - 1)
					.then(resolve)  // <--- we try to remove this
					.catch(reject); // <--- and this
			})
	});
}
```
Well, we could resolve the returning promise with the promise returned by `fetch_retry`! Instead of `fetch_retry(...).then(resolve).catch(reject)`. We could do `resolve(fetch_retry(...))`! So the code becomes:

```javascript
function fetch_retry(url, options, n) {
	return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
		fetch(url, options).then(resolve)
			.catch(function(error) {
				if (n === 1) return reject(error);
				resolve(fetch_retry(url, options, n - 1)); // <--- clean, isn't it?
			})
	});
}
```

Now we could go even further by removing the explicit creation of the `Promise` by resolving the promise in `catch`.

```javascript
function fetch_retry(url, options, n) {
	return fetch(url, options).catch(function(error) {
		if (n === 1) throw error;
		return fetch_retry(url, options, n - 1);
	});
}
```
Quoting from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/catch) with some words tweaked for more layman terms:
> The Promise returned by catch(handler) is rejected if handler throws an error or returns a Promise which is itself rejected; otherwise, it is resolved.

### ES6
I can predict some JS gurus would be hating me for not using arrow functions. I didn't use arrow functions for people who are not comfortable with it. Here is the ES6 version written with arrow functions, I wouldn't explain much.

```javascript
const fetch_retry = (url, options, n) => fetch(url, options).catch(function(error) {
	if (n === 1) throw error;
	return fetch_retry(url, options, n - 1);
});
```

Happy?

### ES7
Yeah yeah, `Promise` is becoming lagacy soon once ES7 async/await hits. So here is an async/await version:

```javascript
const fetch_retry = async (url, options, n) => {
	try {
		return await fetch(url, options)
	} catch(err) {
		if (n === 1) throw err;
		return await fetch_retry(url, options, n - 1);
	}
};
```

Which looks a lot neater right?

In fact, we don't have to use recursion with ES7, we could use simple for loop to define this.

```javascript
const fetch_retry = async (url, options, n) => {
	let error;
	for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		try {
			return await fetch(url, options);
		} catch (err) {
			error = err;
		}
	}
	throw error;
};

// or (tell me which one u like better, I can't decide.)

const fetch_retry = async (url, options, n) => {
	for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		try {
			return await fetch(url, options);
		} catch (err) {
			const isLastAttempt = i + 1 === n;
			if (isLastAttempt) throw err;
		}
	}
};
``` 

# Conclusion
To conclude, we have looked at 4 different versions of the same function. Three of them are recursive just written in different style and taste. And the last one with for loop. Let's recap:

## Primitive version
```javascript
function fetch_retry(url, options, n) {
	return fetch(url, options).catch(function(error) {
		if (n === 1) throw error;
		return fetch_retry(url, options, n - 1);
	});
}
```

## ES6
```javascript
const fetch_retry = (url, options, n) => fetch(url, options).catch(function(error) {
	if (n === 1) throw error;
	return fetch_retry(url, options, n - 1);
});
```

## ES7 async/await recursive 
This is my favorite.
```javascript
const fetch_retry = async (url, options, n) => {
	try {
		return await fetch(url, options)
	} catch(err) {
		if (n === 1) throw err;
		return await fetch_retry(url, options, n - 1);
	}
};
```

## ES7 async/await for-loop
```javascript
const fetch_retry = async (url, options, n) => {
	let error;
	for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		try {
			return await fetch(url, options);
		} catch (err) {
			error = err;
		}
	}
	throw error;
};

// or (tell me which one u like better, I can't decide.)

const fetch_retry = async (url, options, n) => {
	for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		try {
			return await fetch(url, options);
		} catch (err) {
			const isLastAttempt = i + 1 === n;
			if (isLastAttempt) throw err;
		}
	}
};
```
